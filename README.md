# This-Is-Jeopardy-Project
Project to explore the J! Archive with Python Pandas


This project was created as part of the Codecademy Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist Career Path. It is a Data Manipulation Challenge Project that explores the J! Archive with Pandas.

The CSV provided is included in this project as is the Jupyter Notebook 'This Is Jeopardy_Solution'. These were provided by Codecademy for the data to be looked at and one potential solution if I were to get stuck.

The 'This Is Jeopardy' Jupyter Notebook is the solution created by me along with some commented explanation of my thought process. Resources used included Codecademy modules, cheatsheets and articles.

In addition I used resources found online, such as pandas.pydata.org/docs, geeksforgeeks and stackoverflow.
